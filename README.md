Panaversity Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
This project explains the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python with simple examples, notes, and beginner-friendly code.
It is perfect for those who are just starting to learn how to structure their Python code using classes, constructors, and methods.

ðŸ§  Topics Covered
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€” How to write code in a structured way.

Class â€” A blueprint for creating multiple objects.

Importance of Class â€” Easily create multiple instances (objects) from the same class (e.g., multiple houses).

Constructor (__init__) â€” Special function to initialize object properties like the address.

Self â€” Refers to the current instance of the class, allowing access to its properties.

Methods â€” Functions defined inside a class to add functionalities like:

ring_bell()

call_lift()

turn_on_lights()

ðŸ“„ Project Notes
Programming Paradigm:

Teaches how to structure code.

Object-Oriented Programming focuses on using classes and objects to model real-world things.

Class:

A blueprint to create multiple similar but independent objects.

Example: Two different houses created from the same House class.

Constructor Function (__init__):

Automatically called when a new object is created.

Used to initialize object-specific properties (like setting different addresses).

Self Keyword:

Represents the instance of the class.

Used to access variables and methods associated with the current object.

Methods (Functionalities):

Define behaviors/actions that the objects can perform.
